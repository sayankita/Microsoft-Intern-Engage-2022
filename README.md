Welcome to NEWGEN BI

Problem Statement: Develop an application for the automotive industry for fetching insights from the dataset to solve a business problem such as predicting the price and acknowledging  the customerâ€™s reviews regarding the same.

Solution:

-Build a graph with the data set provided
    The application will create graphs with the sample dataset which was provided on the Acehacker website. It then creates clusters of the dataset for easy analysis       of the data by the data analysts present in the automotive industry. For the clustering I have used the k means algorithm, using which I have divided the dataset       into 8 clusters with the help of the code. (click here to check for k means ckustering : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_regression )
    
-Using the dataset provided build a price prediction model
    After preparing the graph for the industry it is also good if the application could forecast them the price like after how many iteration will the price of the         product change. For this I have used the Linear Regression (check for linear regression here:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-means_clustering ) 
    
-For knowing the customer, search for the reviews about a particular company or product.
    For an industry working for satisfying the customers demands what else is better then knowing what the customer likes and dislikes about a particular company's         product so for this purpose I have added the feature to my app wherein the user could read the tweets, for this I have used the twitter API for which I had to         create an account on the twitter developers and after 1-2 days the authority granted me the permission for the same.
